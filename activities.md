## Cloud Security Alliance - Key Management in Cloud Services
**date: 2020.11.10**

I actively contributed to the architecture patterns in the **[Key Management in Cloud Services](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/artifacts/key-management-when-using-cloud-services/)** Guidance document published by the [Cloud Security Alliance Key Management Working group](https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/working-groups/cloud-key-management/).

## Classic McEliece - NIST PQC Round 3 Finalist
**date: 2020.07.23**

NIST [announced](https://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/pqc-forum/0ieuPB-b8eg/Cl7Ji8TpCwAJ) yesterday that [Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org/index.html) is one of the [Round-3 Finalists](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/post-quantum-cryptography/round-3-submissions) in the Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization Process.

_"As such, NIST selected Classic McEliece as a finalist and believes it could be ready for standardization (should NIST choose to select it) at the end of the third round."_

The full report by NIST can be found [here](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2020/NIST.IR.8309.pdf).

The **Classic McEliece** submission in Round 3 is a merger of the _Classic McEliece_ and _NTS-KEM_ submissions to the previous rounds. The submission builds on code-based cryptography with binary Goppa codes, a proposal that has not been broken for more than 40 years.



<br/><br/>
## Blog post on Cryptography Services for Enterprises
**date: 2019.10.21**


I wrote a blog post on "**How to Make Cryptography Services Work for Your Organization**" which was published on the [IBM Security Intelligence website](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/how-to-make-cryptography-services-work-for-your-organization/). Check it out for some real-world lessons learned.


<br/><br/>
## Architect Certification
**date: 2019.10.16**

I completed the Level 2 certification as **IBM and Open Group Architect** in October 2019. This certification is not a one-time sit-down learn-stuff-by-heart and forget-all-again. Instead, I earned the certification by working continuously as architect for multiple years and by demonstrating my achievements to an internal review board at IBM.

I have led several large projects as security architect. My reference projects concerned architectures for smart metering security, cryptography services for financial services, and enterprise security architectures. I followed a series of trainings on architecture, design thinking, consulting and project management. I also specialized not only in security architecture, but also learned how IT is managed for a specific industry: in my case I focused on banks. Further I earned this certification by giving presentations at international conferences and summer schools, by creating reusable assets, and last but not least by mentoring others.

## NIST PQCrypto Classic McEliece submission
**date: 2018.04.07**

[Classic McEliece](https://classic.mceliece.org) Submission to [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography)'s [Post-Quantum Standardization](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography/Round-1-Submissions) together with [Daniel J. Bernstein](https://cr.yp.to/djb.html), [Tung Chou](https://tungchou.github.io/), [Tanja Lange](https://hyperelliptic.org/tanja), Ingo von Maurich, Rafael Misoczki, [Ruben Niederhagen](http://polycephaly.org/), [Edoardo Persichetti](http://persichetti.webs.com/), [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/), Nicolas Sendrier, [Jakub Szefer](http://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~jakub), and [Wen Wang](http://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~wen).

Great to see that my Ph.D. research is relevant for the next crypto standardization, i.e., the parameters in the 2008 paper **Attacking and defending the McEliece cryptosystem** are still holding up.

![screenshot-2008-paper](images/screenshot-2008-paper1.jpg)

Now included as the IND-CCA2 KEM parameters for mceliece6960119:

```
m = 13, n = 6960, t = 119, l = 256.
```

Moreover, more PQCrypto code-based crypto submissions also used my [complexity computations](scripts.html) to determine the security level of their proposals.


<br/><br/>
## Enterprise Key and Certificate Management
**date: 2018.01.09**

I gave a lecture at the ECRYPT winter school in Zurich, Switzerland on how large enterprises manage cryptographic keys and public-key certificates.

[ECRYPT-CSA School on Societal Aspects of Cryptology and on Business and Innovation in Crypto](https://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/events/ecrypt-csa-school-cryptology/ "ECRYPT-CSA School on Societal Aspects of Cryptology and on Business and Innovation in Crypto"), 7-9 January 2018,Zurich, Switzerland.

One of the goals was to bridge the gap between industry and academia. I.e., answering the question: how long will it take to get pqcrypto research into practice in a large enterprise environment.


<br/><br/>
## Blog post: GDPR Readiness
**date: 2017.03.24**

I published an IBM Blog post: [What to expect from the GDPR readiness assessment](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/think/be-en/2017/03/24/expect-gdpr-readiness-assessment/).

## Crypto Workshop Girl Tech Fest Brussels
**date: 2016.05.04**

Together with my IBM Belgium colleagues I organized a crypto workshop for 10-14 year old girls at the [Digital Muse Girl Tech Fest](http://digitalmuse.org/girl-tech-fest-brussels-2016/) in Brussels on Saturday April 30, 2016. We ran 4 workshops where the girls learned how to make and break ciphers - all toy examples of course. Still, lots of fun and great to see that girls enjoy math and crypto!

## Iteration count for ISDFq attack
**Summer 2010**

My paper [Information-set decoding for linear codes over Fq](http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/589) presents a new algorithm for decoding linear codes over arbitrary finite fields Fq.

The repository [https://github.com/christianepeters/isdfq](https://github.com/christianepeters/isdfq)
contains a PARI/GP file for a crude operation count as well as a precise iteration count on the basis of a Markov-chain computation. The implementation is written in C and uses the MPFI library. Details on how to use the implementation can be found [here](scripts.html).


<br/><br/>
## Iteration count for attack on the original McEliece parameters
**Summer 2009**

Iteration count of the [improved variant of Stern's algorithm for binary linear codes](http://eprint.iacr.org/2008/318) by [Daniel J.  Bernstein](http://cr.yp.to/djb.html), [Tanja Lange](http://www.hyperelliptic.org/tanja/), and myself published at PQCrypto 2008.

Compute the iteration counts for our attack on the McEliece cryptosystem using the type-3 Markov-chain analysis.

[https://github.com/christianepeters/isdf2](https://github.com/christianepeters/isdf2)

The implementation is written in C and uses the MPFI library. Note that you might need to increase the level of precision if you consider codes of length greater than 1024. Change the line
```
int prec = 150;
```
to something more convenient.
